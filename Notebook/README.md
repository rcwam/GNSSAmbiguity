# Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) with code examples demonstrating quantum algorithms and related concepts. The notebooks are intended to provide practical implementations and insights into various quantum computing techniques, leveraging IBM's Qiskit and the Quantum Rings SDK for execution.

## Contents

### 1. **100 Qubit QAOA Example**
   - **Description**: A 100-qubit implementation of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).
   - **Libraries Used**:
     - **Qiskit**: For constructing the quantum circuit and managing algorithm implementation.
     - **Quantum Rings SDK**: For backend execution on a local quantum simulator.
   - **Purpose**:
     - To demonstrate scalability of QAOA for high-qubit systems.
     - Showcase integration between Qiskit and Quantum Rings SDK.
   - **Highlights**:
     - Efficient handling of large-scale quantum circuits.
     - Local backend execution for testing and performance evaluation.

## Prerequisites

To run the examples in this folder, ensure the following are installed:

- **Python 3.11**
- **Qiskit**:
  - Installation:
    ```bash
    pip install qiskit
    ```
- **Quantum Rings SDK**:
  - Follow the [Quantum Rings SDK Documentation](#) to set up the local backend.
