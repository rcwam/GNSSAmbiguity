# GNSS Carrier-Phase Ambiguity Resolution Using QAOA

This document outlines how to formulate the GNSS carrier-phase ambiguity problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem and then apply the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). By following these steps, you can represent the integer ambiguities as binary variables, construct a cost Hamiltonian, and define a mixer Hamiltonian to efficiently explore the solution space.

## Step 1: QUBO Formulation

QAOA is designed for combinatorial optimization problems expressed as a QUBO. To use QAOA for GNSS ambiguity resolution, we start by encoding the integer ambiguities \(N_i\) as binary variables.

### Binary Encoding of Integer Variables

Each integer ambiguity \(N_i\) (for satellite \(i\)) is represented by a binary string. Suppose we allow \(N_i\) to range from \(-M\) to \(M\). We can write:
N_i = -M + ∑(bᵢⱼ ⋅ 2ʲ)

where:
- \(bᵢⱼ\) are binary variables (\(0\) or \(1\)) representing the \(j\)-th bit of \(N_i\),
- \(j\) ranges from \(0\) to \(k\), and
- \(k\) is chosen such that \(2ᵏ ≥ 2M\), ensuring the range \([-M, M]\) is fully covered.

### Objective Function in QUBO Form

The carrier-phase measurement for satellite \(i\) is:
Φᵢ = (Rᵢ / λ) + Nᵢ + εᵢ

where:
- \(Φᵢ\) is the observed carrier-phase measurement,
- \(Rᵢ\) is the geometric distance between the satellite and receiver,
- \(λ\) is the carrier wavelength,
- \(εᵢ\) is measurement noise.

To minimize the residual errors, the objective function becomes:
C(b) = ∑(Φ_obs,ᵢ - Φ_pred,ᵢ - λ ⋅ ∑(bᵢⱼ ⋅ 2ʲ))²

Substituting the binary encoding of \(Nᵢ\) into this residual minimization yields a QUBO form suitable for QAOA.

## Step 2: Define the Cost Hamiltonian

In QAOA, the objective function is encoded as a cost Hamiltonian \(H_C\). For the carrier-phase ambiguity problem:
H_C = ∑(Φ_obs,ᵢ - Φ_pred,ᵢ - λ ⋅ ∑(bᵢⱼ ⋅ 2ʲ))²

yaml
Copy code
This Hamiltonian represents the energy landscape of the problem. The QAOA algorithm aims to find binary variables \(bᵢⱼ\) that minimize \(H_C\), thus resolving the integer ambiguities.

## Step 3: Construct the Mixer Hamiltonian

The mixer Hamiltonian \(H_M\) ensures exploration of the solution space by enabling bit-flips among the binary variables:
H_M = ∑(Xᵢⱼ)

yaml
Copy code
where \(Xᵢⱼ\) is the Pauli-X operator acting on the qubit corresponding to \(bᵢⱼ\). The mixer moves the system through different binary configurations, preventing the algorithm from getting stuck in local minima.

## Putting It All Together

1. **Initialization**: Start with all qubits in a uniform superposition.
2. **Apply \(H_C\)**: Introduce the cost Hamiltonian to encode the objective function as an energy landscape.
3. **Apply \(H_M\)**: Use the mixer Hamiltonian to explore different states.
4. **Iterate**: Alternate between applying \(H_C\) and \(H_M\) for a set number of layers.
5. **Measure**: After the final iteration, measure the qubits. The resulting binary string corresponds to the set of integer ambiguities \(Nᵢ\) that minimize the residual errors.

## Advantages of QAOA for GNSS Ambiguity Resolution

- **Efficient Exploration**: Quantum superposition allows simultaneous exploration of many \(Nᵢ\) configurations.
- **Scalability**: QAOA can handle combinatorial complexity as the number of satellites or measurements increases.
- **Robustness**: The algorithm can adapt to noisy conditions common in real-world GNSS data.

This QAOA-based formulation provides a structured quantum approach to accurately and efficiently resolve GNSS carrier-phase ambiguities.
